Titanic Data Science Project (DSP)

This folder contains my working files and analysis for the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. The goal is to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques.

Contents:

· train.csv: The training dataset with known survival outcomes.\n
· test.csv: The testing dataset for generating predictions.\n
· Code files (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts) for data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and modeling.\n
· Any additional resources or outputs.

Project Purpose:

This is a learning project for practicing the complete data science pipeline: data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, validation, and prediction submission.
